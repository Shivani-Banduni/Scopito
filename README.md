# Image Report Application

This project is a React-based application that allows users to interact with an image populated with clickable markers. Clicking on a marker can either display a form for submitting reports about issues detected at that marker's location or generate a detailed random report for the issue.

## Features

- **Interactive Image with Zoom**: Users can interact with an image that supports zooming in for a closer look.
- **Markers with Custom Reports**: Clicking on different markers on the image will either display a form for the user to submit a report or generate a random detailed report about an issue at that location.
- **Dynamic Form Submission**: A form component allows users to submit reports about issues, with fields for issue details, component affected, issue type, severity, resolution status, repair cost, and additional comments.
- **Thumbnail Previews**: Below the main image, users can click on thumbnail images to change the main displayed image.

## Components
